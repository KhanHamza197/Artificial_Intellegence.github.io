					<td>Gaming</td>
					<td>Almost all games across the world have NPCs, or non playable characters. Many games, such as Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Elden Ring, exclusively have NPC characters you interact with. What makes these NPCs so fun is their AI. This ranges from having the NPCs attack you if you come near them, to having dialogues with you. Even board games now use AI. A great example of this is Chess, in which you can fight NPCs that are way better than the best chess player in the world.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Search Engines</td>
					<td>If you have ever used a search engine, you would notice after a few searches, you would start to get recommended things based off of what you previously wrote. This is the work of Artificial Intelligence adapting to your previous searches.</td>

You could be wondering how to make pizza flavored ice cream, or how to insert chess into a website, chat bots can answer anything. Certain chatbots are used by websites to help guide users through experiences as well, such as the following chatbot.</td>
