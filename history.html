                    <h3>During the early 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the idea of artificially intelligent robots. This gave birth to a new generation of scientists who were familiar with the topic of artificial intelligence. One such scientist was Alan Turing who published a paper discussing how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence.</h3>
