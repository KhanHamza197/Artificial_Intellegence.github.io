					<h2>Singularity</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The singularity is a point in time where AI overtakes humans. This will happen in the very near future. AI already learns at incredible rates, and once they become smart enough they might just overtake us. It is scary to imagine what might happen then, however there's nothing we can really do about it. At this point AI will probably have replaced humans at all the jobs they used to have as well. This is the main problem with AI. </p>

					<h2>Cybersecturity</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>While AI helps advance many fields like medicine and travel, there are many places where AI is working against us. One such field is cyber security. AIs are able to fully automate scams very easily. On top of this, AIs are surveilling humans all the time. With the amount of information they gather, they could cause some serious repercussions.</p>
