			<h1>What is AI</h1>
			<div class = "about_what">
				<p class = "about_text">There have been many definitions over many eras of what artificial intelligence truly is. John McCarthy defines it as, " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable," in his 2004 <a href = "https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai.pdf" target = "_blank">paper</a>. Artificial intelligence all originated from the question, can machines think. Since this question, AI has advanced a lot, and in todays day and age, many machines certainly can think. However to understand this concept, we have to understand how AI works.</p>

				<p class = "about_text">AI works by teaching a machine something, machine learning. The 2 types of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning.  Supervised learning is when you help the machine learn with a lot of data. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is when you let the machine do whatever it wants until it eventually learns how to function properly. This is much like how a child learns to walk and bike. AI is applied in many different fields, using computer vision, speech recognition, and many other applications.</p>
